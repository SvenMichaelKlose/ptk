ptk is a lightweight cross-platform user interface written in C++.
ptk can run as a toolkit for applications running on other user interfaces
or as a standalone application for environments where system ressources are
low.

ptk consists of three layers, each in a separate library:

	- libptkdrv: Hardware dependend drivers for keybord, pointer,
	  display, drawers and window shells.

	- libptk: Framework for drawing and auto-layout.

	- libptktoolkit: A simple toolkit.

ptk uses only standard ANSI-C++ features so you're free to use your
preferred components like libsigc++ for signals.
